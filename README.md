# Rockmelon Detection Using Mask RCNN
This is part of a summer research project which involves capturing an rockmelon image dataset and using them to train a machine learning model to detect rockmelons. 

The Mask RCNN model used is based on [Matterport's implementation](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN).
